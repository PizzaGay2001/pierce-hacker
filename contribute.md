# Here are a handful of ways you can contribute to this project:

## Compose a Tutorial

Have an idea for a novice-friendly technology tutorial? PierceHacker wants to work with you to publish it. 

We are looking for tutorials and lessons that develop the array of technological skills and practices that will help a diverse community of learners thrive in an evolving world. 

* *Students* -- use a technology in or outside your classes that you think might benefit your peers in their own life and work? Get in touch with us.
 
* *Teachers* -- use a technology that you think might benefit students across the curriculum or beyond? Get in touch with us.
 
Check out our [tutorial proposal form](/assets/tutorial-proposal-form.txt).

Check out our [guide on how to compose a lesson best suited]({{ site.baseurl }}/contribute/2019/06/05/author_tutorial.html) for the PierceHacker project.

## Write for Our Blog

In addition to tutorials, PierceHacker also seeks to publish blog posts that creatively, critically, and reflectively explore issues related to technology both in and outside of the classroom. 

For example, do you have knowledge of, or experience with, an issue like [digital redlining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_redlining)? Share your knowledge. Let us work with you to publish a blog post. 

Check out our [blog post proposal form](/assets/blog-proposal-form.txt).

## Send all Blog/Tutorial proposals to this email:

**jloan@pierce.ctc.edu** - Start a discussion with us and see what can be **improved upon** and **approved.**

## Use PierceHacker in Your Class

The PierceHacker site -- even while in the incubation stages -- is always live and public. Here are some ways to use PierceHacker in your class.

#### Links to Resources
We encourage you to share links to existing tutorials relevant to your courses.

#### Class Projects

Teachers -- we also encourage you to use PierceHacker to develop writing assignments or projects in your class: 

* Use a particular technology that students struggle with? Have them learn it by trying to teach it to each other. Ask students to propose and compose a tutorial for us. 
* Want students to write creatively, critically, or reflectively about technology? Ask your students to propose and compose a blog for us.
* Want students to practice being a reader of others' work by reviewing and providing feedback for in-progress tutorials and blog posts? Ask them to be a reviewer for us.
* Need a [rhetorical situation](https://wac.colostate.edu/resources/wac/intro/rhetoric/) for a writing assignment or project? Let us be your rhetorical situation.

At the moment we do not yet have any specific lesson plans or modules for use in your classes. We hope to have some soon. For now, we encourage you to contact us to discuss possibilities and logistics. 

We cannot, of course, publish everything proposed and composed for us in your classes, but we would sure like to try!

## Join the PierceHacker Team

PierceHacker runs via volunteer and class project power. At the moment, this a volunteer staff of one -- Jason. When Jason teaches Technical Writing, which is often, he invites students to engage, contribute, and work on PierceHacker.

This project in many ways started from Jason's own desire to learn some new skills and processes involving things like GitHub and [minimal computing](http://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/). Have a skill you can contribute? Want to learn something new? PierceHacker welcomes you. Get in touch.
